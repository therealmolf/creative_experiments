# Creative Experiments

This repository serves as a collection of creative coding experiments, primarily utilizing the p5.js library. It's a space for exploring interactive art, generative design, and various visual and auditory programming concepts.

## Structure

- `sketches/`: Contains individual p5.js projects, each in its own subdirectory.
- `assets/`: Stores resources such as images, data, and sounds used across different sketches.
- `libraries/`: Includes necessary JavaScript libraries like p5.js and p5.sound.js.

Feel free to explore the different sketches and experiment with the code!
